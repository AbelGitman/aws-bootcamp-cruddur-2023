# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching


## DynamoDB Bash Scripts

```sh
./bin/ddb/schem-load
```


## The Boundaries of DynamoDB

- When you write a query you have provide a Primary Key (equality) eg. pk = 'andrew'
- Are you allowed to "update" the Hash and Range?
  - No, whenever you change a key (simple or composite) eg. pk or sk you have to create a new item.
    - you have to delete the old one
- Key condition expressions for query only for RANGE, HASH is only equality 
- Don't create UUID for entity if you don't have an access pattern for it


3 Access Patterns

# Pattern A  (showing a single conversation)

A user wants to see a list of messages that belong to a message group
The messages must be ordered by the created_at timestamp from newest to oldest (DESC)

```sql
SELECT
  messages.uuid,
  messages.display_name,
  messages.message,
  messages.handle,
  messages.created_at
FROM messages
WHERE
  messages.message_group_uuid = {{message_group_uuid}}
ORDER BY messages.created_at DESC
```

# Pattern B (list of conversation)

A user wants to see a list of previous conversations.
These conversations are listed from newest to oldest (DESC)
We want to see the other person we are talking to.
We want to see the last message from whoeever last wrote.

```sql
SELECT
  message_groups.uuid,
  message_groups.other_user_uuid,
  message_groups.other_user_display_name,
  message_groups.other_user_handle,
  message_groups.last_message,
  message_groups.last_message_at
FROM message_groups
WHERE
  message_groups.user_uuid = {{user_uuid}}
ORDER BY message_groups.last_message_at DESC
```

# Pattern C (get a message_group)

When a user creates a message we need to update the conversation
to display the last message information for the conversation

```sql
UPDATE message_groups
SET 
  other_user_uuid = {{other_user_uuid}}
  other_user_display_name = {{other_user_display_name}}
  other_user_handle = {{other_user_handle}}
  last_message = {{last_message}}
  last_message_at = {{last_message_at}}
WHERE 
  message_groups.uuid = {{message_group_uuid}}
```


## Serverless Caching

### Install Momento CLI tool

In your gitpod.yml file add:

```yml
  - name: momento
    before: |
      brew tap momentohq/tap
      brew install momento-cli
```

### Login to Momento

There is no `login` you just have to generate an access token and not lose it. 
 
You cannot rotate out your access token on an existing cache.

If you lost your cache or your cache was comprised you just have to wait for the TTL to expire.

> It might be possible to rotate out the key by specifcing the same cache name and email.

 ```sh
 momento account signup aws --email andrew@exampro.co --region us-east-1
 ```

### Create Cache

```sh
export MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN=""
export MOMENTO_TTL_SECONDS="600"
export MOMENTO_CACHE_NAME="cruddur"
gp env MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN=""
gp env MOMENTO_TTL_SECONDS="600"
gp env MOMENTO_CACHE_NAME="cruddur"
```

> you might need to do `momento configure` since it might not pick up the env var in the CLI.

Create the cache:

```sh
momento cache create --name cruddur
```
